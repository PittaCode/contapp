## How to run

There are two way to run the web app locally (on your computer).

### Using the flash built-in command (preferred way)

1. Navigate to the root of the project.
2. Activate your environment where you have installed the `flask` framework (if applicable)
3. Run the command `flask run`

### Using the python interpreter directly

1. Navigate to the root of the project.
2. Activate your environment where you have installed the `flask` framework (if applicable)
3. Run `python app/app.py`
_Note: This only works because I added some code at the end of the root file (app.py)._
